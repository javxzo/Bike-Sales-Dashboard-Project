# Bike Sales Analysis Project

This project is in-depth analysis of a bike sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. 

### Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Started by cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency amongst different columns and data types. This involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing formats.

2. **Dashboard Creation**: Utilizing Excel's features, I created a dashboard! This dashboard includes:
   - **Pivot Tables**: To summarize and analyze data from different perspectives.
   - **Sliders**: To interactively filter and manipulate data views.
   - **Charts and Graphs**: To visually represent data trends and insights.

### Some Tools and Techniques!
- **Excel Functions**:  `IFS`, `TRIM`, `CLEAN`, `SUMIFS`, `XLOOKUP`, `VLOOKUP`, duplicate manipulation and more.
- **Pivot Tables**: For data summarization and analysis - _my favorite part_.
- **Interactive Controls**: Sliders and slicers for user-friendly data manipulation.
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs to highlight important metrics and trends.

### Outcome!
The final deliverable is an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that provides insights into the bike sales data and a fully cleaned bike sales dataset.

## Dataset!
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information on bike sales, such as:
- Average Income Per Purchase
